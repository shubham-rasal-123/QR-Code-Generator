# QR Code Generator

This project is a QR Code Generator built with [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) that creates QR codes from user-provided text or URLs. The program generates a scannable QR code image that can be saved and shared, making it useful for links, contact information, or other data. It uses Python libraries like qrcode to generate the codes and Pillow for image formatting. This project is ideal for learning about data encoding, image generation, and Python libraries.
